Sam:
This project was pretty fun, I liked it a lot. I really liked how we were able
to use a library to parse the command line arguments, as I get really finicky
about parsing. I guess, if I were to do this assignment again, I would try and
refactor the Client and Server classes into a generic class somehow.
